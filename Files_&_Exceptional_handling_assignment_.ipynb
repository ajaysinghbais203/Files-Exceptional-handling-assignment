        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "- Interpreted languages (like Python) execute code line-by-line using an interpreter. This allows for easier debugging and platform independence but can be slower. Compiled languages (like C or C++) are translated into machine code before execution. This makes them faster and more efficient but less flexible during development.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "- Exception handling is a mechanism that allows a program to deal with unexpected errors during execution. Instead of crashing, Python lets you catch and handle these errors using try, except, else, and finally blocks, ensuring the program continues running smoothly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "- The finally block is used to define cleanup actions that must be executed under all circumstances—whether an exception was raised or not. It's commonly used to close files, release resources, or reset states.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "- Logging is a way to track events that happen when software runs. Python’s logging module allows developers to record messages at different severity levels (like debug, info, warning, error, and critical), which helps in diagnosing problems and understanding program flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the del method in Python?\n",
        "- The del method is a special method called a destructor. It is automatically invoked when an object is about to be destroyed, allowing you to perform cleanup tasks. However, relying on it is discouraged because the timing of its execution is not guaranteed.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "- import module: Imports the entire module. We access functions with module.function(). from module import function: Imports specific functions or classes, allowing direct use without the module prefix.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python? - You can catch multiple exceptions using multiple except blocks or by grouping them in a tuple:\n",
        "try:\n",
        "except (TypeError, ValueError) as e: print(\"Caught an exception:\", e)\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "- The with statement simplifies file handling by automatically managing file opening and closing. It ensures that the file is properly closed even if an error occurs during processing:\n",
        "with open('file.txt', 'r') as f: data = f.read()\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "- Multithreading: Multiple threads run in the same process and share memory. Best for I/O-bound tasks. Multiprocessing: Multiple processes run independently with separate memory. Ideal for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "- Helps in debugging and monitoring\n",
        " - Records runtime events\n",
        " - Supports different severity levels\n",
        " - Can log to files, consoles, or remote servers\n",
        " - More flexible and powerful than print()\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "- Python handles memory automatically using reference counting and a garbage collector. It allocates memory for new objects and reclaims it when objects are no longer in use, helping prevent memory leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "- Following are the basic steps involved in exception handeling: try: Wrap code that might raise an error except: Handle specific exceptions else: Run code if no exception occurs finally: Always run cleanup code\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "- Efficient memory management ensures that your program uses system resources wisely, avoids memory leaks, and maintains performance, especially in long-running or data-intensive applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "- Beow are the role of try and except in exception handling: try: Contains code that might raise an exception except: Catches and handles the exception, preventing the program from crashing\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "- Python uses reference counting to track object usage. When an object’s reference count drops to zero, it’s deleted. It also uses a cyclic garbage collector to detect and clean up reference cycles.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "- The else block runs only if the try block doesn’t raise an exception. It’s useful for code that should only execute when no errors occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "- DEBUG: Detailed information for diagnosing problems INFO: General events confirming things are working WARNING: Something unexpected, but the program still works ERROR: A serious problem that prevents part of the program from working CRITICAL: A severe error causing the program to stop\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "- os.fork(): Low-level, Unix-only method to create a child process. multiprocessing: High-level, cross-platform module that simplifies process creation and communication.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "- Closing a file ensures that all data is written to disk and system resources are released. Failing to close files can lead to data corruption or memory leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "- read(): Reads the entire file content as a single string readline(): Reads one line at a time, useful for large files\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "- The logging module provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs. It helps track events, errors, and system behavior during execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "- The os module allows interaction with the operating system. In file handling, it helps with tasks like checking file existence, creating directories, renaming, and deleting files.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "- Detecting and cleaning circular references. Managing memory in large-scale applications. Avoiding memory leaks due to lingering references. Balancing performance with memory usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "- We can raise exceptions using the raise keyword to signal an error intentionally: raise ValueError(\"Invalid input provided\")\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "- Multithreading is useful in I/O-bound applications like web servers or file operations. It allows multiple tasks to run concurrently, improving responsiveness and performance."
